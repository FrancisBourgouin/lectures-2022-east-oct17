A versatile veggie that's easy to understand

Potatoes and little chickens, a match made in heaven
A tasty treat that can't be beat, on your plate they'll be leavin'

Little chickens, so cute and small
Running around, having a ball
Feathered friends that we all adore
Delicious to eat, and so much more

Potatoes and little chickens, oh so fine
Together they make a meal that's truly divine
Potatoes and little chickens, a match made in heaven
A tasty treat that can't be beat, on your plate they'll be leavin'

So don't be shy, give them a try
Potatoes and little chickens, they'll satisfy
Your hunger and your taste buds, they're sure to please
A perfect pair, that's guaranteed to never cease

Together they make a meal that's truly divine
Potatoes and little chickens, a match made in heaven
A tasty treat that can't be beat, on your plate they'll be leavin'
